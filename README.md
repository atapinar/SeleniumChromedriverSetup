# SeleniumChromedriverSetup

## Summary
This Python script uses Selenium WebDriver to automate opening a website in a Chrome browser. It leverages webdriver_manager to automatically manage ChromeDriver installation, ensuring compatibility with the installed Chrome version. The code initializes the WebDriver and navigates to the Financial Times website (https://www.ft.com/). This setup is helpful for automating browser interactions without manually handling ChromeDriver downloads or updates.
